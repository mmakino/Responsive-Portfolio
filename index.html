        I have been an engineer in semiconductor indutry for about 20 years.
        The companies I have worked for provide yield management services
        for semiconductor manufacturing companies worldwide, based on complex
        systems of wafer testing equipments, and proprietary software systems
        for analyzing the data. I develop whatever software tools needed to
        connect and integrate such different components as IC design,
        inspection data, and analysis software. The two most interesing
        aspects I love are, communication and problem sovling. I constantly
        communicate with different groups of people such as IC layout designers,
        equipment application engineers, and data analysts and consultants
        to identify, understand, and troubleshoot whatever issues we have.
        In order to make the system of different components work as a whole,
        I use my knowledge and skills to implement solutions in software tools.

        Born to parents of social science professors in Japan, I grew up wanting
        to be a philosopher (seriously!) as a child. Interestingly, I went to the
        University in Reno, Neveda, where I have my B.A. in Sociology (why I ended
        up in Reno all the way from Japan is another story). When I crashed into
        a crummy dorm room, I encountered a roommate in Computer Science major.
        Since then my life started changing dramatically. Although I attempted
        to get a degree in CS as well, I left there with minor in CS when I had
        a job offer for an application engineer.
